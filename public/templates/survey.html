	<p>
		If you might be interested in living in a tiny house community, please take a few minutes to help us make Bittyburb <span style="font-weight:bold;">your</span> ideal. We have no way of knowing what you want in a tiny community unless you tell us.

		We also invite you to visit our <a ui-sref="Contact">contact page</a> to ask any questions you have, or schedule an interview with us. The more info we can gather about your tiny intentions, the greater the chances Bittyburb will become a community youâ€™d love to live in.
